- 👋 Hi, I’m Brendan (@RITBeast)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning github - I've used Git in several jobs, but never maintained an instance myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of the CI/CD pipeline, terraform and AWS
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate, just poking around and testing things out.
- 📫 How to reach me ???
